**Simple modules. Clear meaning. Growth without chaos.**

- **Simple modules:** Each module has a clear responsibility. Modules can be composed without ambiguity.
- **Clear meaning:** Names and file structures reflect their purpose.
- **Growth without chaos:** Easy to add hosts, users, or features without breaking existing configurations.
